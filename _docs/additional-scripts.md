## UV Scroller

Used in the *Wanderer* demo scene. It scrolls waterfall texture along the Y axis. Also used in *Ocean Water* scene under the waterfall.

## Linear Motion

Linear Motion is a simple script that translates (moves) and rotates any object. We used it heavily on cameras to prepare promo video footage. There is an option to translate or rotate along the X, Y, Z axis.

> **TIP.** Use a couple of instances of this component if you want to translate and rotate along more than one axis and make more complex automations.

## Buoyancy

This script is used with *Water* shader specifically when there is an object on the water surface, and you want it to physically flow on this surface. The object will replicate the water's shape, while water is being deformed. This scripts is added on the object as a component. You'll need to point to the water object mesh this object is interacting with (in *Water* field of the script interface).

* *Water* field is where you choose the mesh of the water surface. The object holding this script will be afloat on this mesh.
* *Size* parameter sets the definition of the movement, meaning, how many of the *Water* object's vertices it takes into account.
* *Amplitude* is how far the object travels from its initial point on the water while floating.

## Auto Load Pipeline Asset

This script is set on Camera as a Component. It automatically loads a URP Asset file for this scene only. This way there is no need to create the single URP Asset file for the whole Unity project â€” every scene can have its own one, which makes each scene in the project portable and easy to move, duplicate, A/B test etc.
