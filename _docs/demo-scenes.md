We tried to depict the big spectrum of possibilities using various scenes. They are one of ten million examples of possible Flat Kit use cases. Consider viewing them as starting points or macro-preset objects for your own project.

# Valley and Wanderer
*Valley*, *Wanderer* scenes are environmental. There we tried to show the work of both fog systems of Flat Kit. Also it is one of the perspectives of displaying the shaders — how these would look in a large scene.

Valley uses Terrain shader and transparent textures inside a Stylized Surface Cutout shader. Valley demo scene is also an example of obvious, rather than subtle, use of *Fog* Image Effect. Once the scene is loaded, you can scan through the *Fog* Image Effect presets to find which one you like more. There is a Presets chapter later in this manual with explanation of how to use them.
In a *Valley* scene, please note that although the ground is made with Unity native terrain, the trees on it are populated manually, not using the terrain system.

# Blueprint Grid (Mugs) and Fruit Vase
*Blueprint Grid (Mugs)* and *Fruit Vase* scenes are an exhibition of most sought use cases of cel / toon shading.

However, you can find more experimental stuff there, too. It has been a temptation to overpopulate the scenes with content, because while making these included materials — literally dozens of interesting by-product or work-in-progress materials showed up, but we had to discard them to keep the scenes clean.
Blueprint Grid is a descriptive one, there is a text telling what we used to get the displayed materials.
Fruit Vase is actually a collection of 7 scenes. There is one vase with fruits across all scenes and each scene is dedicated to some specific look, thus uses a different set of materials.

# Tree Island
*Tree Island* scene is a showcase of a more cartoony use case. Imagine a 3d-platform game with such a look. Or a ny other arcade game.

# Room
*Room*. We just had to include a room.

# Retro Cars
*Retro Cars*. Retro cars are curvy. A great opportunity to show how shiny (or rough) shaders can be.

# Normal Map Tree
An example of normal maps application.

# Ocean Water
This is a demo scene showcasing the *Water* shader in a way the game would look like. A non-toon-shading application for *Stylized Surface* is showed in this scene, too. You can choose various water looks in the Hierarchy tab by switching different Water objects on.  

> **NOTE:** This scene will work in Universal RP only.

# Pool
*Pool* scene shows more various versions of the *Water* shader. In the Hierarchy tab you can choose between different water objects. Each of these objects has its own *Water* material.  

> **NOTE:** This scene will work in Universal RP only.

# Water Vessels
*Water Vessels* is an shows a few simple and more non-obvious *Water* shader parameters in a single scene. Having these materials, you can use them as starting points in you own projects.  

> **NOTE:** This scene is in Universal RP only.
